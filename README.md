# Getting Started

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies
```
npm install
```

### 2. Add Your Avatar Image
The project requires an avatar image to display on your business card.

**How to create a new folder (if needed):**
- The `images` folder already exists in the project
- If you ever need to create additional folders, you can:
  - **Via File Explorer/Finder:** Right-click in your project directory and select "New Folder"
  - **Via Terminal/Command Line:** Run `mkdir foldername` (replace `foldername` with your desired folder name)

**Add your image:**
1. Place your avatar image in the `images` folder
2. The default image name is `cheryl.jpeg` (as referenced in `index.html`)
3. Either:
   - Name your image `cheryl.jpeg`, or
   - Update the `src` attribute in `index.html` to match your image filename

### 3. Run the Project
```
npm start
```
